Clinical Trial Search App https://trial-map-59509387646.us-central1.run.app/
LLM generated clinical filters based on the conditions tag for each clinical trial provided by clinical trials . gov API and a Gemini Assistant for verifying eligibility based on the official eligibility (inclusion and exclusion) criteria

Clinical Trial Matcher
Overview
An intelligent clinical trial discovery platform that leverages AI to help patients find relevant clinical trials based on their medical conditions, age, and specific health profile. The system streamlines the traditionally complex process of clinical trial matching by automating data retrieval, intelligent categorization, and personalized filtering.
Key Features
🔍 Smart Trial Discovery

Real-time data integration with ClinicalTrials.gov API
Automatic fetching of recruiting trials based on primary diagnosis
Support for multiple trial statuses and filtering criteria

🤖 AI-Powered Taxonomy

Uses Google Gemini AI to automatically categorize medical conditions into structured taxonomies
Organizes conditions into three main categories:

Genetic Conditions: Chromosomal anomalies, hereditary syndromes, gene mutations
Recent Medical Events: Acute symptoms, surgical interventions, recent diagnoses
Other Major Diagnoses: Chronic diseases, primary malignancies, systemic conditions


Intelligent mapping from raw condition strings to standardized medical terms

🎯 Personalized Filtering

Age-based filtering: Automatically filters trials based on patient age eligibility
Condition-based matching: Multi-select checkboxes allow patients to specify their exact health conditions
Dynamic results: Real-time trial list updates based on selected criteria
